# Replication Code for "The Origins of Mass Incarceration"

This repository contains replication code and (most) of the data required to make those graphs. In a couple of cases I have not included data because it is proprietary. 

Note that the various .R files create many more graphs than are included in my final presentation or the Appendix. So you may have to search for the graph in which you're interested. The .tex file should help you find it, but if you have any trouble, please just email me.
