This repository contains replication code and (most) of the data required to make those graphs. In a couple of cases I have not included data because it is proprietary. 

Note that the various code files create many more graphs than are actually included in my final presentation. So you may have to search for the graph in which you're interested. The .tex file should help you find it. 

Any questions/comments, please email me.
